# Go file encoding

All Go source files are assumed Unicode, encoded in UTF-8. Which means that the following is a valid program:

```go
// You can edit this code!
// Click here and start typing.
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello, 世界")
}
```

> Source code in Go is defined to be UTF-8 text; no other representation is
> allowed. ([https://blog.golang.org/strings](https://blog.golang.org/strings))
