# Why Go?

> What happened to Python Sops? We rewrote Sops in Go to solve a number of
> deployment issues, but the Python branch still exists under python-sops. We
> will keep maintaining it for a while, and you can still pip install sops, but
> we strongly recommend you use the Go version instead.
