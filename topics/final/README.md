# Final project

## Project 1 - Write a small Guestbook application

* write a server
* write two handlers: one for posting a message, one for displaying all messages

Example:

    /        list all messages
    /post    receive posts, through GET or POST requests (test with curl)

No need for a database, all data can be stored in memory. How could one
implement limits on this update?
