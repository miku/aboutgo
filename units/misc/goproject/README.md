> Go is a new language. Although it borrows ideas from existing languages, it
> has unusual properties that make effective Go programs different in character
> from programs written in its relatives. A straightforward translation of a C++
> or Java program into Go is unlikely to produce a satisfactory resultâ€”Java
> programs are written in Java, not Go.
