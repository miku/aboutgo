# Learning Go

Collection of units to learn [Go](https://golang.org/) and related topics.

Inspired by [ardanlabs/gotraining](https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/):

* There is a folder [units](units), which contains text and code for a specific
  topics. This is the interesting folder, which can be extended in small steps.
* There is a folder [courses](courses), which can group many units - serving as
  schedule for a workshop or training session.
