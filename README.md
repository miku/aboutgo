# Learning Go

Collection of units to learn [Go](https://golang.org/) and related topics.

Inspired by [ardanlabs/gotraining](https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/) and [notes on Ultimate Go](https://github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go).

* There is a folder [topics](topics). This is the interesting folder, which can
  be extended in small steps.
* There is a folder [courses](courses), which can group many units - serving as
  schedule for a workshop or training session.
